Hey everyone,

So I wanted to learn a new language to add to my tool-belt and after long consideration, I decided on Golang. 

There were a few reasons for this but, the base reason is because I wanted to get into API developing and I thought Go would be good to learn. Go and Python have several similarities so it took a bit but, I followed guides and the training provided by Go and wanted to show a small project that I was able to do.
