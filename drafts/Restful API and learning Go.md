Hey everyone,

So I wanted to learn a new language to add to my tool-belt and after long consideration, I decided on Golang. 

There were a few reasons for this but, the base reason is because I wanted to get into API developing and I thought Go would be good to learn. Go and Python have several similarities so it took a bit but, I followed guides and the training provided by Go and wanted to show a small project that I was able to do.

A lot of what I will go over is found is here [https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin] and I used this as a jump point for my code. To start:

```
package main

```
